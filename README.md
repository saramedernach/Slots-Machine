The object of the game is get a row of matching symbols by spinning the pieces on the board.  Players have the option between selecting either the "Spin" or "Max Spin" button.  "Spin" will cause only the symbols in the middle row to change.  If all three symbols in the row end up matching, the player will be rewarded 5 credits.  If not, they will then lose 5 credits.  "Max Spin" will cause every symbol on board to change.  Players win if all three symbols in any one of the rows or a diagonal match.  For each matching row and diagonal, the player is rewarded 10 credits.  However, if there are no matching triples, they will lose 25 credits.
